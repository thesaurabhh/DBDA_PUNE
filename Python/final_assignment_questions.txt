(2, 5)

5.Write a Python program to count most and least common characters in a given string.

Sample :
Original string:
hello world
Most common character of the said string: l
Least common character of the said string: h

6. Write a Python program to count the occurrence of each element of a given list. 

Sample :
Original List:
['Green', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Orange', 'Black', 'Black', 'White', 'Orange']

Count the occurrence of each element of the said list:
Counter({'Red': 2, 'Orange': 2, 'Black': 2, 'Green': 1, 'Blue': 1, 'White': 1})

Original List:
[3, 5, 0, 3, 9, 5, 8, 0, 3, 8, 5, 8, 3, 5, 8, 1, 0, 2]

Count the occurrence of each element of the said list:

7.Write a program that calculates a user's BMI using the user's weight and height.
BMI is calculated by dividing the person's weight in kg by the square of the person's height in meters. Round the result to a whole number.

Sample : 
height = 1.85
weight = 75

Output: 22

8.Create a program that takes the user's current age as input and calculates how many days, weeks, and months they have left to live if they would get 99 years old.

For this exercise, we assume that a year has 365 days, 52 weeks, and 12 months.We don't take leap years into account!

Print the final result to the console using an f-String!

Sample :
Please enter your age today : 36
Output :
You have 22995 days, 3276 weeks, and 756 months left to live a joyful life !

9. Print a greeting to the screen, welcoming our user to the Tip Calculator.
Ask the user how much the total bill is and store the value in a variable.
Ask the user how much percent tip they want to give the waiter and store the value in a variable.
Ask the user how many people they want to split the bill between and store the value in a variable.
Calculate how much each of your friends has to pay if the bill, including tip, is equally spread among them.
Round the result to two positions after the comma and print it to the console

Sample1:
When you input the following amounts:
Total bill: 150
Tip percentage: 12
Split between people: 5
The total amount paid by each person should be 33.60, not 33.6

If the bill is 150 split between 5 people with a 12% tip, you can use this formula to calculate the final amount each person has to pay (feel free to use any other formula to get to the result!):  150/5 * 1.12

Sample2 :
If you enter the following values:

Total bill: 180
Tip percentage: 15
Split between people: 4

Output:
Each person has to pay : 51.75

classmethod   
   get_instructors_so_far_for_the_course()
   // append to the existing list in this func
   set_instructors_so_far_for_the_course(instructor_name) 

create a function main that 
a) creates an obj of course class with values
   DIOT-Python,Elon Musk,CEO at Tesla ,Cdac,"Sample Feedback"

11. Write exception handling for below code's invocation block
import time

conclude = "And what leads you to that conclusion?"
district = "Finest in the district, sir."
cheese = "It's certainly uncontaminated by cheese."
clean = "Well, it's so clean."
shop = "Not much of a cheese shop really, is it?"
cust = "Customer: "
clerk = "Shopkeeper: "


def fun(reaper):
    if reaper == 'spam':
        print('spam')
    elif reaper == 'cheese':
        print()
        print('Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Beautiful Spam')
    elif reaper == 'mr death':
        print()
        return('{}{}\n{}{}'.format(cust, shop, clerk, district))

def more_fun(language):
    if language == 'java':
        test = [1, 2, 3]
        test[5] = language
    elif language == 'c':
        print('{}{}\n{}{}'.format(cust, conclude, clerk, clean))

def last_fun():
    print(cust, cheese)
    time.sleep(1)
    import antigravity


# invocation code below where you need to do try,except block and 
# make sure you program does not throw an exception
# rather prints with a message to the user on what went wrong and ask him to retry atleast once

first_try = ['spam', 'cheese', 'mr death']
joke = fun(first_try[0])
not_joke = fun(first_try[2])
langs = ['java', 'c', 'python']
more_joke = more_fun(langs[0])


12. Write a program to find the count of "triple" value in a string. 
A "triple" in a string is a sequence of characters appearing thrice times in a row. 

Return the count of triples in the given string. The triples may overlap

Sample:

triple_counter("defXXXdef") returns 1
triple_counter("zzzabxxxxcd") returns 3 since xxx and xxx is present but in overlapping state 
triple_counter("f") → 0



13. Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a string ouput that is n copies of the original string.


string_multiplier('Hi', 2) → 'HiHi'
string_multiplier('Hi', 3) → 'HiHiHi'
string_multiplier('Hi', 1) → 'Hi'


14. Below we've provided a list of tuples, where each tuple contains details about an employee of a shop.
